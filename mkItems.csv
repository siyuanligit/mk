This was my first mechanical keyboard. A few things that are slightly annoying is the shift key under the enter key is smaller than normal so I hit the up arrow a lot. Then the rubber pads on the bottom leave a bunch of skuff marks on my white desk. Good keyboard overall.,I really enjoyed this keyboard while it worked,  after using it for a while the micro-usb port broke. This was partially my fault for taking it out of the house, but it is also because of the fragile port, if you are just going to use this keyboard for home use then i strongly recommend it, but if you plan to take it with you places like i did, then i would recommend getting a sturdier model.,This is a great keyboard. I love the layout because it's both compact yet still has a separate function key row above (and separate ESC vs ` keys). These switches are also very quiet, even compared to my Das Keyboard with brown switches (not all brown switches are equal, apparently!). I'm actually giving up a topre switch keyboard for this one -- I loved that keyboard but I think I love this one even more. Additionally, the build quality seems pretty solid so far. The only issues I see are very minor: if you look closely, the legends are not absolutely perfectly aligned; and as others have reported, some of the keys are not going to be easy to replace with custom keycaps (but given these keycaps are dye-sub PBT, you shouldn't *have* to replace them for a very long time).,This is an amazing keyboard. The built quality and the included keycaps are both great.,Being as this is my first mechanical keyboard I have absolutely no complaints. I just started getting into the whole mechanical keyboard community, and I have been researching like crazy what would be the best keyboard for my daily driver. Lo and behold this beauty came up in my research, and it is awesome. The cherry clear switches are great, and unlike many people I had no issue removing the keycaps from my unit. Now the keycaps did take the old wiggle wiggle trick to get them off, but by lifting up gently/consistently while wiggling the keycaps slightly the keycaps came off without a hitch. The responsiveness and feel of this keyboard is great! I like the color palate that is provided with this keyboard, but I wish there was a red delete key with this keyboard to balance out the red ESC key for better summitry. Overall I love this keyboard, and I look forward to my next keyboard purchase. MechanicalKeyboards.com got my board to me within 2 days, and were responsive in answering any of my questions via email or Facebook.,Build quality and look is top notch. Very, very happy with my purchase. ,This is a great keyboard. The DSA PBT caps are very nice to type on. Clears are definitely my favorite switch type between them, blues, browns, and reds.The 75% layout is really well done and the colored keycaps look amazing. My favorite keyboard I've owned so far.The one big complaint I have that is that the keycaps that are not 1x sized are very difficult to remove. Following guides to slowly wiggle and hold the stem down with a flat head screwdriver was not enough. I ended up pulling the stem out on both shift keys because it required so much force that I lost control of the  screwdriver holding the stem from ripping. I was close to doing the same for the enter and escape keys. Resoldering the switches was required, but now some of the keys are sitting higher, probably due to some of the stems almost being ripped out.I wish there was an option to buy the keyboard with colored caps on already. Would have have saved me a lot of stress ,I finally found my perfect keyboard. 75% layout since I use the right column navigation keys and arrows a lot for text editing, and the PBT material feels amazing (great slight texture). This is something I can use at work without pissing off coworkers. The feel is definitely less crisp than the traditional Cherry red switch on plate, but the reduced sound (certainly not silent) makes this keyboard worthwhile to me as a general purpose kb for use between both work and home without having to do a bunch of dampening hacks especially since many methods (e.g. GMK clips) don't work great with these DSA profile keycaps or completely ignore the upstroke. I'm using this straight out of the box with zero mods. No pinging, haven't tried programming yet.,Man, I love this keyboard. The keycaps, have that perfect shape. All the keys you need are here. The brown switches are outstanding. It looks fantastic. This bored is an absolute win.The Cherry Brown MX switches are really the way to go -- I had the clear switches on a WASD 61-key keyboard and I felt like the keys were giving me a workout because they were so difficult to press. The reds I had on another board were lifeless -- I couldn't understand why anyone would want those. But the reds were better than the clears.,I really love this keyboard.  I had already been using a WASD TKL keyboard with custom keycaps for a few months (my first mechanical keyboard) when I decided to purchase this for use at work, so I had some experience with a keyboard with Cherry Browns.This Vortex really raised the bar for me, though.  The PBT caps have a much nicer feel, the aluminum frame is super compact and weighty, and the programming capabilities of the keyboard really work out well for my everyday tasks.It's great looking and as compact as possible.  Not noisy at all (especially with some o-rings).The only downside is that you can only upgrade the firmware from a Windows PC, and my stock firmware wasn't working right with Mac mode.  I programmed the command and alt keys to swap positions, though, and that made the Mac mode a non-issue.It's so nice that a coworker went out and ordered one for himself only a few days later after testing out mine (though he is using his in Dvorak mode).There are no DIP switches on this thing, either.  Everything is done through keystrokes, which I prefer.  The settings are saved, as well, so you don't have to redo everything once you unplug it.Highly recommended.,I think I'm in love with this keyboard. This is my first keyboard with mx clears and now I'm really glad I chose them for work. This is the first keyboard I've used where it's actually really difficult to bottom out while typing so even while typing fast the noise is minimal.,I got this keyboard recently and after only 3 days I realized it had a horrible design flaw. The Micro USB plug on the board is not secure, it can easily recede inside the board and it won't work anymore. Don't think I'll ever buy one of these again, shame because it is quite nice in design, but I don't have confidence in getting a new one because It will probably happen again.,Love the layout, the switches and the overall quality for the price.Highly recommended to anyone hesitating.Only con I see is the side print for ""Scrlk"" on the F11 key is slightly higher than the other side prints. Could be a problem for some. I don't mind.,Very well built, but I just couldn't type comfortably and accurately on it. I love the MX Silver switches, however. I might try the Vortex Vibe.,LONGWINDED REVIEW including shopping experience. Def not expert just my experience and opinion. 2nd Vortex KB,  Race 3 is the perfect layout for my daily use.  Does not feel compact - prefer the color layout as well. 1st Clear KB -stiffer than browns -not sure if I prefer the actuation of the browns vs. clears. FLAT Profile - Not keen on the flat profile so keycaps will be replaced but do like  these key caps, bummer. It might change the way I feel about the switch.KEYCAPS REMOVAL - I used the smaller puller and damaged my enter key when replacing the keycaps (same day), however, receiving today, Leo FC980M to replace the one I spilled coffee (same day - wife shaking her head). Race 3 Keyboard itself has a nice weight to it - 7th KB this year - This one is a def contender for daily use - My FC900 is great for work but gave away Razer 2 months old - blues -too loud. Next to give away - Poker 3 and FC660M - both browns but after a few months of use, I miss having designated FKeys. Hoping the Race 3 does the trick to end my pursuit for the perfect daily board. While it benefits the folks at MB, wifey is now beginning to count KBs :(     MB - This is KB number 4 of 5 purchased since the summer. No problems whatsoever, customer service is great and fast replies without scripted -robotic dialogue. Shipping is fast but def allow yourself the right amount of time for shipping. I travel a lot so time zones can make a difference if you def. need the KB a certain day. Again, no complaints at all. Last comment - I ordered key switches from MB to replace the dead keys on the 1-day old Leo FC980M. I'll leave a review so stay tuned to whether or not it becomes a door stopper or my wife's new KB. ,I love this thing.,One of the best keyboards I have ever used. I am in love with it. 75% is the perfect size as I have to use the Arrow Keys every few minutes to do tasks at work. The included additional color keys are fantastic. MX Browns are amazing, medium noise and not enough click noise for the office. The build quality is fantastic. I am going to get Vortex Race 3 with MX Clears if it ever becomes available. The included key caps are fantastic. No need to replace them. My Order arrived in Canada in 10 days. Very happy with the service from Mechanical Keyboards. ,love this board so much, perfect size, great looks, nice and clicky without being too loud. caps lock has a LED to display status. only downside is the micro usb connection as far as I'm concerned, I'd prefer USBC or even type A in this context. I worry about the long term durability of the connection but we shall see. ,This keyboard is top notch. I got a vortex Pok3r recently and loved it. I loved the size which was much better then my full size Ducky. The only thing missing was the arrow keys. Then I seen the Race 3 and knew this would be the perfect keyboard. I wasn't mistaken at all. This keyboard is top notch in every way! The only complaints I could find about it where the fact that the key caps wouldn't be easily replaced. I gotta say I like the included key caps a good deal. The vintage flare of the gray is a nice touch. I like the legends and profile of the caps. I really think stock caps on this keyboard are more then fine specially being PBT. Then the included RGB caps for certain keys are just icing on the cake. Overall I am exceptionally pleased with this keyboard. ,This board is one of my favorites. A lot of people complain about the non-standard top row but the keycaps it comes with are great. PBT, dye-sub, dsa profile, and the Mac AND rgby modifiers that are included add up to me not giving two hecks about a non standard top row. I currently just have the red esc and ctrls on and its beauty brings a tear to my eye. It feels as good as it looks, too. The construction quality is probably the best I've seen on any keyboard, and the cherry browns are probably my favorite cherry switch. I tried the screw-in feet for a bit but I prefer it sitting flat without them.As far as non-topre boards go, this is my number one.,Such a tight little 75 percenter. The larger escape key is a little weird, but it's so pretty out of the box with the extra RGBY keys that I don't want to put custom caps on it anyway. ,Pros:1. Silver MX feels great.  I like it more than mx reds.2. The keycaps it comes with are really nice, especially at this price point.3. The extra (colored) keycaps are also pretty cool.4. Being able to switch between colemak, dvorak, qwerty is quick and possible with the default keycaps as they are all the same profile.5. The case is heavy, durable, very high quality feeling.Cons:1. It stops working often.  I've tried this keyboard on 4 different workstations varying in OS, including Win7, Win10, Mint 18.2, Debian 9.  Swapped out different USB cables, checked connections; no luck.  Sometimes I can go hours with it working fine, other times it will stop working every 10 minutes. 2. The two non-standard 1.5u keys (ESC/DEL) on the top row make finding custom keycaps hard.3. Programming it is not as easy as it should be that other keyboards have achieved.4. The keys seem a little too squished together (more than the product pictures let on to).  I've got very average sized hands and I find myself clipping the wrong key often.  I was most excited for this to replace my daily driver, a Realforce 87U TKL 55g, with something lighter (MX Silver is perfect) but it's just too unreliable and the keys just feel too close together.   The search continues, I guess.,Just premium in every way!,This keyboard is amazing. Silver switches and dsa keycaps are a great combination. it feels very well built also and has a good weight to it. by far my favorite keyboard I've owned.","VTG83BLKMSLV,VTG83BLEMSLV,VTG83BRNMSLV,VTG83REDMSLV,VTG83SRDMSLV,VTG83CLRMSLV,VTG83SVRMSLV","{'Brand': 'Vortex', 'Model': 'Race 3', 'Size': 'Tenkeyless', 'Physical Layout': 'US QWERTY', 'Logical Layout': 'ANSI', 'Frame Color': 'Silver', 'Primary LED Color': 'n/a', 'Control LED Color': 'n/a', 'USB Key Rollover': 'Full', 'Multimedia Keys': 'Yes', 'Switch Mount Type': 'Plate', 'Built in Audio Port': 'No', 'Built in Mic Port': 'No', 'Interface(s)': 'USB', 'Windows Compatible': 'Yes', 'Mac Compatible': 'Yes', 'Dimensions': '12.21"" x 4.73"" x 1.18""', 'Weight': '1.69 lbs', 'Cord Length': '60 inches'}","Cherry MX Black,Cherry MX Blue,Cherry MX Brown,Cherry MX Red,Cherry MX Silent Red,Cherry MX Clear,Cherry MX Silver","Chris,Spencer Robinson,M.

I love the feel of the board, it is very compact and I love the feel of the Cherry Blue's. I am coming from a DAS Keyboard 4C. I have been using this keyboard for a few years and decided to upgrade to something a little more modern. Vortex has delivered well on the quality of the board. I recommend this board to those that are looking to get into mechanical keyboards for a decent price. Definitely premium. ,Best Keyboard I have used. SA keycaps are solid and feel nice. Keyboard has got some weight to it, and the programming is nice,Got this as my first mechanical keyboard, and I couldn't be happier!

I think I'll get a set for my keyboard. - There's a backspace key. Also, the long 0 key has been shortened and a 00 key has been added. This is actually quite useful. I find myself reaching for these keys on other numpads and being disappointed. - Just on its own, the look on people's faces when I pull out the Pocket to do calculations is worth the price. - The instruction manual is very easy to understand, which is good considering how many hotkey functions there are. Cons:- Ducky calls this the Pocket, but I'm not sure what kind of pockets they had in mind. It's much too bulky to be truly portable. Which is too bad, because I'd love to carry it around everywhere.- Configuring the LED colors isn't quite as easy as on Ducky's full-size keyboards. - The battery life is shorter than I'd like, and I wish it used something other than a CR2032 coin battery. - The backlight on the display is too bright. Maybe there's a way to turn it off, but I haven't found it. It stays on as long as its plugged in, even when my PC is off. I have to flip the switch on my power supply every night so I can sleep. Fortunately, the dimensions of the display are almost exactly the same as a stick of chewing gum, so I can cover it up. It would be nice if the display turned off when idle. Firmware update, maybe? - Despite what's shown in that promotional video, the Pocket is no good as a gaming keypad. At least, not in the way it's shown. The keys are arranged in four columns, and I think a decent gaming experience would need five. Players might find it very useful for macros and such, but it's no substitute for conventional WASD controls. The Ducky Pocket is not that good as a pocket calculator or a gaming keypad. It is, however, excellent for the more essential functions like productivity and making people say: ""what the?"",Solutions found with this little amazing keyboard:- Responsive with tactile feedback that the key you pressed was actually taken in consideration for input/calculation. Different from normal cheap calculators with mushy keys that frequently fail on me;- Give me back an agile numeric keypad when using my notebook, that speed up my data entering, specially when typing numbers;- The backlighted keys, associated with the tactile ""-"" sign help me position my hand quickly to enter data without looking at the keypad all the time.- Video editing with vegas is much faster using the directional keys (PC2 mode)- Being able to disconnect the keypad and work independently as a calculator gives me freedom to perform basic calculations to record on paper when a computer is not available.Really loved this product. ,Grabbed one to accompany my Ducky One TKL keyboard. I must say, this numpad is amazing! I really like the ability to use it as a calculator on the fly. Lighting is not super bright but bright enough for my tastes. Build quality is very nice, the outer case is made out of a very sturdy-feeling plastic that doesn't flex at all, and the PBT keycaps feel very nice. Overall, it is an excellent numpad. I highly recommend it.,This numpad is well priced for what it offers. The only problem I have encountered is that the display light is already malfunctioning after only one month of use. I don't think I'll be sending it in though since it seems like a hassle to ship to Taiwan for repairs. MK Edit - If this was purchased from us, please send it in to us for repair. Email us if you have any questions. ,Love it!I was going to get a razer nostromo then I saw this and I'm glad I did. It's much cheaper, has more buttons. You just remap it and go, no silly ram stealing software. Build quality is fantastic. I dropped it HARD during unboxing and not a scratch. My gaming style is lap boarding in a big comfy chair so the small form factor puts my left hand in the perfect position in relation to the mouse which is good for my carpal tunnel issues. Two profiles and easy switching is a plus too. The lighting options are really nice and help me get my hand in place in the dark. It performs flawlessly in game. Not much other praise I can give, for what it is.A few petty cons: The setup of the keys and lighting is somewhat tedious if you are a software config fan (I'm not), programming it to my liking took quite a while and there are a few key typo's in the manual, which slowed it down even more. Calculator. I'll probably never use it, and it adds bulk to an otherwise perfect peripheral. Also I'm not a big fan of the red switches but the others are currently out of stock, I'll probably mod it. One other thing is the clear switch housings that make it a bit overly blingy for my tastes, lol light shining out all over. Black electrical tape should solve that.,Got this to tag along with my code tkl for programming duty. The functionality is excellent, from thw keystrokes, to the functions and macros. The build quality is excellent. My only gripes are that the legends on the keys lack contrast and the back lighting is quite dim next to my WASD CODE TKL. Overall, it's an excellent product.

The quality control is poor. Now I have to buy another keyset as this imperfection is going to drive me nuts. Warning, you will need to buy more keycaps if you use your keyboard a lot (even when its only been less than 2 months). Great price but quality control is garbage.,Brilliant Keyboard. Metal base is sturdy and gives a fantastic typing experience as it allows you to really slam down on the keys with little to no flex at the bottom out. I've only used cherry blue switches before this so I was a bit hesitant to use the clears but I love them just as much! They are signifigantly heavier than blues but not enough for any type of fatigue to set in. I purchased this for work and the clears are just as satisfying to type on as the blue but don't disturb everyone around me. I would recommend this keyboard to anyone who likes 60 percent keyboards like myself. My only gripe about the keyboard is the fact that the default location of the arrow keys seems a bit strange.,BOb, that is a very helpful review.  Why in the world would you have purchased a keyboard if you knew you wanted more than 60 something keys?  And then cry about it to the rest of the world?,I discounted this keyboard because it didn't have pbt keys. I was always an ABS fan but after the Poker the and set of PBT Leopolds I decided  I was a PBT fan.The ABS keys on this board give a wonderful typing experience.  It just feels different at first.  I now prefer ABS again.  Of all by boards the Poker 3 LED is my favorite.  It's sturdy, handsome, programmable, and does everything I need.  A comparable board to this would be the V60 which I really like, but the key caps are of lesser quality and the case is plastic, not metal.  IT does however make it lighter, so some may prefer this.Vortex is coming out with the RGB version of this board.  I have to say I have little interest in that.  I prefer plain old white light, but this is a matter of preference.  If  you love the Poker and you think you can deal with the caps, than get this board.,Overall good. Green keys feel great. But it does have some coil whine when the backlight is on.Trying to let it run to see if that eliminates it, but no luck yet. Would be a 5 without the coil whine. ,I have had this keyboard for a few days now, and am absolutely in love!  The clear mx switches are by far my favorite, and have a unique heavy but smooth feel and a very pleasing 'thock' sound that I did not anticipate.  I decided to give clears a go because i found mx browns to be a bit too mushy while not providing enough feedback, and found my mx blues just too loud for an office environment.  My previous 60% keyboard was a ducky mini, and compared to that, the pok3r is much more intuitive and a all around better experience.  The main reason for this is the positioning of the arrow keys.  On the ducky mini, arrow keys were accessed via 'olk;' so you have to move your hand to a special position just to use them.  On the Pok3r, arrow keys are set to 'ijkl', which means I don't have to move my hand off my home row to use them.  It is fantastic.  I highly recommend flipping the 3rd dipswitch on the back of the keyboard to convert your capslock key into a function key to make use of the arrows even easier.  As far as backligting goes, the white led's give off a very nice looking glow, especially combined with the white backplate.  They can get super bright if that's your thing, and can be reasonably dim too.The ABS keycaps are just what you would expect.  They're kind of light, and smooth to the touch.  The font is tastefully done.  I got this keyboard to put in a custom case with some SA keycaps, so these stock caps were not a factor in my purchasing.  All in all, fantastic board.  Cherry Mx Clear switches are by far the best in my opinion, and the layout and build quality of this board is second to none.,I was on the fence between buying the KBParadise V60 and this keyboard.  What sold me on this keyboard are the clear advantages - the aluminum case, programming, and the solid construction.The Cherry MX Clears are a dream to type and game on.  If you're questioning the pros / cons of these switches, trust me - you will not regret these one bit.  My previous switches were Cherry MX Browns, and these feel much like them, but improved.  It's hard to describe, but trust me - they are fantastic.One criticism is that this keyboard has laser etched ABS keys.  90% of you will probably swap out the keycaps for something fun anyway, so if you're new to the Pok3r / 60% layout, you'll quickly learn the function layer and have no need for the stock keycaps with front printing anymore.Another criticism about this keyboard is the lack of volume controls.  They're there.  A firmware update added the controls with a simple function   key combo.  The firmware update was already on the keyboard I received.  You have no reason not to buy this keyboard for lack of volume controls.  The only thing you'll be missing is the front printing on the keycaps.  See my comment above about the keycaps.This keyboard is solid. Other 60% keyboards have a plastic shell.  This comes STOCK with an aluminum case.  You will find that every key press feels more solid.  I have had zero issues with keys bottoming out or making pings on the case.  I transport this between home and work in a soft case, and don't worry about it being damaged.The only potential downside for some users is the one color backlighting.  At the time of this review, an RGB backlighting Pok3r is coming.  If you need those colors to complete your life, by all means wait and buy that model.  If white is your thing, or don't need backlighting at all (you can turn it off), then this is the keyboard for you.In summary, the amount of features in this keyboard at this price point is well worth the price.  If you're comparing this to other 60% keyboards, I think you will be very happy with this purchase.,Amazing keyboard. Incredible tying experience.,This keeyboard is ****ing stupid because it's missing 40% of the keys","PKX6100-AEPVW3,PKX6100-BEPVW3,PKX6100-CEPVW3,PKX6100-WEPVW3,PKX6100-REPVW3,PKX6100-GEPVW3","{'Brand': 'Vortex', 'Model': 'POK3R', 'Size': '60%', 'Physical Layout': 'US QWERTY', 'Logical Layout': 'ANSI', 'Frame Color': 'White', 'Primary LED Color': 'White', 'Control LED Color': 'White', 'USB Key Rollover': '6', 'Multimedia Keys': 'Yes', 'Switch Mount Type': 'Plate', 'Built in Audio Port': 'No', 'Built in Mic Port': 'No', 'Interface(s)': 'USB', 'Windows Compatible': 'Yes', 'Mac Compatible': 'Yes', 'Linux Compatible': 'Yes', 'Warranty': '1 year', 'Dimensions': '11.60"" x 4.01"" x 1.50""', 'Cord Length': '59 inches'}","Cherry MX Black,Cherry MX Brown,Cherry MX Blue,Cherry MX Clear,Cherry MX Red,Cherry MX Green","Joshua ,Derek D,Jeff Coffin,Jeff,John ,Benjamin,Jimbo,Jonh,BOb"

However, I do know that 9 months in, my ""f"" ""v"" ""0"" and ""del"" keys all work ,Great keyboard for its price tag. Quality as expected for plastic. The spacebar and shifts have the same pleasant sound as other keys. And clear switches are what I was looking for, found browns too light. ,Not much to say that hasn't already been said.  Board is plastic but feels just as sturdy, if not more so, than my Das4.  Cherry clears feel great as I don't like the low actuation force of the brown/reds for typing.  Noise is minimal in an office setting and black caps don't look out of place professionally.  10/10 for me.  ,Really impressed with this keyboard. The construction is extremely solid with no creaking or flex at all. At 2.43 lbs the Ducky One TKL weighs in heavier than the Filco Majestouch 2, KUL ES-87, and the Leopold FC750R. The OEM profile PBT double shot keycaps are the same ones used on Ducky One TKL backlit models. They have the nice ""sandy"" feel associated with PBT and the top side printing is very subtle. The Cherry MX Brown switches have a nice amount of tactile feedback without the noisy click of Blue switches. I installed 2mm 40A-L o-rings to further dampen the sound when bottoming out since I have a tendency to hit the keys pretty hard. The English translations in the manual could be clearer, particularly the instructions for programming macros, but it can all be deciphered with a little effort. Did a lot of research into various mechanical TKL keyboards before deciding on the Ducky One TKL - definitely pleased with the decision.,had this keyboard for about a week now.(switched from coolermaster to this)there is definitely a noticeable difference with the general feeling of it. the pbt keycaps are smooth and nice to touch on. overall its a pretty great keyboard and ducky doesnt disappoint.","DKON1687-AUSPDAAB1,DKON1687-BUSPDAAB1,DKON1687-CUSPDAAB1,DKON1687-RUSPDAAB1,DKON1687-PUSPDAAB1,DKON1687-GUSPDAAB1,DKON1687-QUSPDAAB1,DKON1687-WUSPDAAB1","{'Brand': 'Ducky', 'Model': 'One', 'Size': 'Tenkeyless', 'Physical Layout': 'US QWERTY', 'Logical Layout': 'ANSI', 'Frame Color': 'Black', 'Primary LED Color': 'n/a', 'Control LED Color': 'n/a', 'USB Key Rollover': 'Full', 'Switch Mount Type': 'Plate', 'Built in Audio Port': 'No', 'Built in Mic Port': 'No', 'Interface(s)': 'USB', 'Windows Compatible': 'Yes', 'Dimensions': '14.04"" x 5.24"" x 1.61""', 'Weight': '2.43 lbs', 'Cord Length': '60 inches'}","Cherry MX Black,Cherry MX Brown,Cherry MX Blue,Cherry MX Red,Cherry MX Silver,Cherry MX Green,Cherry MX White,Cherry MX Clear","Derek Allen Simon,Thomas,Oleksandr,Nate,John McDonnell,Erick Pham"

I'm not a gamer so I needed this board to have on the road with me. Since I work quite a bit from my hotel room, I needed something not as clicky and it's why I went with browns. I tried others cherry switches but looks like browns is where I feel most comfortable. Back to the Poker. The color is bright white not off white. The case has a nice solid weight to it. PBTs are the way to go. Only thing that I noticed is the space bar makes a bit of a rattle noise.I did try to swap the keys and perhaps it needs to be re-seated. The only real downside to the board is more of a preference.  :(  I miss having a dedicated Delete Key, however, it wasn't a deal breaker and the board is definitely a keeper. I did inquire about the FC660M and shared with Evan from MK the need of a delete key but only in passing (not a complaint). Within minutes I received details about the board I was looking for and a suggestion for a different board to help with my issue. Unfortunately I waited too long to pull the trigger. That being said, I picked up (2) other boards and key caps since then. All transactions have been flawless! I'll post reviews for those as well. GAVE 5 STARS because the ""downside"" is more of a preference and didn't feel it should reflect the board and the space bar might be more of a user installer error.  Again, not a game but do use my keyboards quite a bit. ,The keyboard is made well and the aluminum casing is very nice. Programming keys is pretty simple, and the switches feel great. ,So I'm coming to this board after using a CM Quickfire Storm with Cherry MX Blue switches for about a year and a half and as of writing this review I've had the Pok3r for 5 days now. Let me just start off saying that when I type I like to give that extra ""umph"" to pressing down my keys and these Cherry MX Black switches feel great to push down on. The whole keyboard feels a lot more sturdier and well built as a whole. Though there isn't the clickiness I was used to hearing, the audible feedback is still pretty satisfying, just not as obnoxious which I was used to. It's also important to note that this is my first 60%  board, and so far I've found that I didn't really use the other keys nearly as much as I thought. My only regret with this purchase is that I didn't buy the backlit version! The LEDs in the capslock key and the spacebar are so nice I wish I had it in the whole keyboard. Overall, I love this keyboard and would recommend it to anyone interested in high quality mechanical keyboards. ,Excellent. Each time I type, I can feel the quality of the caps.

Perfect introduction to 40% keyboards. I ordered mine with the MX Clear switches which I also highly recommend for anyone who is looking for a quieter keyboard to use at work.The micro usb cable that came with mine was kinda crap. It's fitment wasn't that great which caused the cable to move around in the port. This would lead to the keyboard losing connection. I replaced the cable with one off Amazon for 8$ and have had zero issues since. ,With MPC now you are able to program the entire keyboard with ease. There are three modifier (pn,fn,fn1) to program with on 3 layers. As a programmer, I found this keyboard was the best for me. I moved all pinky keys (mainly the symbols with shift) to thumbs : pn on left thumb and fn1 on right space. I can finally remember numbers 5 to 9 as well as use arrow keys without leaving the home row. I also have ctrl/shift inst (copy / paste) mapped to macros.Worth to mention that mine came with mx silver switches. To my surprise, on vortex core, they are stiffer than the silver switches on my corsair. I always wished the silver could be stiffer towards the bottom so that I can avoid bottom out, and this is god send! Overall build quality is great! I felt like I was playing mahjong. I worried about the micro usb port so I bought a magnet usb cable.,This keyboard is amazing!,Great form factor.The keycaps feel as amazing as any quality PBT keycaps do.There is much less typing noise than on other keyboards like the Anne Pro and KBParadise V60.After updating the firmware, you can switch Caps Lock  TAB.It's just really great to type on, and the build quality is superior!,My first and only MK until now was a Magicforce 68, which I honestly love, but I needed something more portable. Got the Core and absolutely do not regret it at all. The learning curve is definitely there, and will definitely take some getting used to considering the fact that it's 40% (obviously). Build quality is wonderful. Sturdy, great finish to the product, and very clean. When you get yours, make sure to update the firmware on it via the Vortex website, which fixes some of the defaults on the keyboard and allows you to program the space bars separately and makes a few things a little more conventional and comparable with some of the other boards. Overall a great keyboard and would definitely recommend it to anyone that's looking for a 40%,GOODDDDDDDDDDD,The quality of this keyboard is fantastic. Really nice for a first time 40% user like myself. Delivery was faster than expected. Very satisfied.,This is a great 40% keyboard. It is really well designed, and works quite a bit like other vortex poker keyboards, so if you are familiar with the programming on those, this will be very similar. The great thing about this keyboard vs a planck is that it is much easier to program than creating a flashing a custom firmware to the keyboard. As mentioned in another review, the only real big downside that I've hit so far is that although there is a separated space bar, which is cool, they cannot be programmed separately, which is a shame. Other than that, this is a great quality pre-built 40% keyboard. This review was written on it, and I found nearly all the punctuation I was looking for :-),The best 40% layout I've used. The key position have been very well thought out. Also, the manual is wrong when it comes to the symbol keys location. I've contacted Vortex and they told me that this is a mistake with the manual, not the keyboard malfunctioning. The programmability is a must have feature on a keyboard of this size. ,This keyboard has excellent build quality. Baseplate exhibits no flex and the switches and PBT keys are top notch. However, either my keyboard's software is defective, or the user manual describing the default Fn1 shift layer is incorrect- all symbols (ie !@#$%^&amp;*()_ ) are on row 2 from the top (not R1 as in the manual) and shift Fn1  b corresponds to "", n to ?, m to {, , to }, and . to |. Programming one of the spacebar keys will result programming the other with the same function, thus, for example, you cannot program the left spacebar to function as a backspace and the right spacebar as space (both spacebars will act as backspace). Caps can't seemed to be programmed to Fn either. Overall, the learning curve seems to be rather steep, particularly due to the keyboard's limitations.","VTG47BLKBEG,VTG47BLEBEG,VTG47BRNBEG,VTG47REDBEG,VTG47CLRBEG,VTG47SVRBEG","{'Brand': 'Vortex', 'Model': 'Core', 'Size': 'Other', 'Physical Layout': 'US QWERTY', 'Logical Layout': 'ANSI', 'Frame Color': 'Gray', 'Primary LED Color': 'n/a', 'Control LED Color': 'n/a', 'USB Key Rollover': '6', 'Multimedia Keys': 'Yes', 'Switch Mount Type': 'Plate', 'Built in Audio Port': 'No', 'Built in Mic Port': 'No', 'Interface(s)': 'USB', 'Windows Compatible': 'Yes', 'Dimensions': '9.75"" x 3.00"" x 1.00""', 'Weight': '0.90 lbs'}","Cherry MX Black,Cherry MX Blue,Cherry MX Brown,Cherry MX Red,Cherry MX Clear,Cherry MX Silver","Brandon,D W,Christopher Miller,Joon Lee,willerz,suwat,Dave,John,Anthony,Switchguy"

This keyboard feels awesome to type on and has a very high quality build to it compared to other mechanical keyboards I've used. Also love the style and colors of the key caps used. The whole keyboard has a very clean professional look to it. I can't recommend this one enough. I will recommend this brand to anyone else looking to get a mechanical keyboard that has a solid typing feel and high build quality.,I have been using this keyboard for a couple of days (my first MK), and I'm really liking it so far! The board itself is solid and weighty, the keycaps are solid but light, and it goes really well with the Cherry MX Brown switches. I've been using it for both gaming and work-based typing and it's been a charm for both! My only complaint is the legend on keys with alternate symbols. The numbers and symbols are right next to each other and looks kinda funky. I wish the symbols were stacked one on top of the other instead of side-by-side. It's not a deal-breaker, but I feel I need to dock a star for it.,Feels so much better than my KG010 knock switches. Also smaller profile and very comfortable to type on. Pair that with simple aesthetics and you've got a great keyboard for gaming, everyday use, and whatnot. I highly recommend. Note: I chose Cherry MX brown switches. ,It looks nice, feels nice, smells like Chinese plastic, tastes like electricity.I am currently describing the picture on my monitor, as FedEx currently has it in Ohio and currently has it progressing at a quarter of a state per day. I am currently typing this on a rubber dome keyboard filled with flakes of food and various blends of soda, that I got from a salvation army; as I had to sell my other keyboard to pay for this one. let this be a cautionary tale, just buy the fastest shipping option you can.,Very happy with this keyboard and MechanicalKeyboards.Com's customer service. I got this for my brothers birthday and he absolutely loves it and is diving into mechkeys himself!!,This is my first Ducky keyboard and I really like this keyboard. Been using it for about a month now and came from using Kalih browns and really like the Cherry MX Brown switches. Easier keypress but still has a nice tactile feeling. The frame is really nice as well. Came with a nice keycap puller. I also bought some red ducky replacement caps to go with my grey/red/ build. The only thing that I sometimes notice is that the lights for the numlock are super bright. Other than that I really enjoy this keyboard and wouldn't hesitate to buy another Ducky. The browns are a nice in between for reds and blues. If you are getting your first mechanical keyboard I would suggest going with browns. You have the tactile feedback and they are not super loud like blues. However, if you have a heavy hand I would probably pick up some blues as they require a little more force to activate the switches for the keys.,This keyboard is excellent. Ducky never disappoints when it comes to build quality and this new iteration of the Ducky One is no exception. I love the understated design and Ducky's placement of volume/calculator button(s) at the top right of the board. The PBT Keycaps feel great and will last forever. This keyboard comes with several replacement blue keys to add some flair to your board in addition to a nice wire keycap puller. Overall, this is a great value compared to the expensive garbage the mainstream ""gaming"" companies sell. I enjoy the Cherry MX Brown switches. These will be perfect for an office environment.

I've owned 2 mechanical keyboards which were the K70 Rapidifre and the Blackwidow Ultimate 2016, and so far this is the best one to use. I use this for gaming on the go and gaming at home, and it never fails to disappoint.Pros:Build Quality (plastic, but little to no flex)RGB lighting is dim-ish (good for my taste)Double shot keycaps (feel very nice to type on)PortableCons:I haven't found any yet,This keyboard is awesome. I've only had keyboards with cherry mx blue switches and I have to say, the browns are much better for playing video games but not for typing (I like them a lot more than the blues for that reason). The lighting looks amazing and I like that it is managed through the function keys rather than an external software. The PBT caps feel amazing as expected. Overall, the build quality seems to be awesome. I highly recommend this over any other TKL keyboard in this price range (ex. the cooler master TKL keyboard) simply because this keyboard has pbt keycaps and I'm almost sure that the build quality is much better. ,Overall great quality keyboard.complaints:Picture shows dots on the spacebar but mine did not have any dots on it. Not a big deal but it just bothers me that I didn't get exactly what the picture shows.The lightning is dim.,This is my second mechanical keyboard after my Varmilo with Gateron Browns turned out to be unreliable (that's another story). Overall, the Ducky feels surprisingly nice to type on. I didn't think there'd be a big difference, but this thing just feels amazing. It's kind of weird how much I'm enjoying typing on it.  It's quieter and feels far more stable. The stabilizers on wide keys are smoother. Pushing on the right corner of the space bar perfectly registers every time. Additionally the stabilizers are very quiet (the Varmilo stabilizers were the dummy switch type, but made this horrible high-pitched rattle that felt like nails on a chalkboard). Overall, it's incredibly nice to type on.As far as the LEDs go, I've never had an RGB board before, but it's been pretty fun setting up different schemes. Pro tip: it seems that hitting fn-1, 2, 3, 4 will switch profiles. Within each profile, fn-f11 and fn-f12 store customized RGB patterns. The interface for setting this is hard to remember, but with a cheat-sheet in front of me, it wasn't too hard to setup cool gradients etc. They've implemented quite a bit of flexibility on this thing! Probably my only complaint about the lighting is that the lock LEDs (caps, scroll, num lock) are hidden behind the rather tall Ins, Home, and PgUp keys so they're hard to see. But that's a pretty minor quibble, and is probably related to my poor typing setup where the board is too far in front of me.The double shot PBT keycaps feel very nice,  with no perceptible seams between the keycap and the legend. I'm not sure if they contribute to the sound, but this thing is pretty quiet. That said, I have two minor issues. First, a few of my keys clearly have the black portion of the key not thinned away properly in parts of the legend. This leads to nonuniformity across some legends. This isn't a big deal, but the ""e"" is almost entirely dark on my Pause button with LEDs lit. My second complain it, similar to another reviewer here, having the primary and secondary symbols side-by-side instead of one on top and one on bottom seems silly to me. I'm getting used to it, but I wonder why not just use the standard? The build quality of this board seems very high, but I have one minor issue (it may not even be an issue--we'll see over time): When the board arrived, it was slightly twisted, causing it to rock when set on a flat surface. I twisted it a bit the other way, and the plastic creaked a bit, but seemed to stay put. So for now, it's perfectly flat and doesn't rock at all, but it would be annoying if I had to keep doing this over time. It's only been a week, so we'll see. The USB cable routing is really nice since I use this on the couch sometimes and I don't want to have to worry about straining the connector. Overall, I'm quite impressed with the feel of this board. The combination of the keycaps, solid construction, and MX Browns feels and sounds really, really nice. Having three options for the height is also really nice. Let's just hope these switches hold up unlike the Varmilo/Gateron combo I just threw in the garbage. ,This is my first mechanical keyboard, and on the whole I like it pretty well, but I do have one or two issues. I'm a touch typist, but that doesn't extend to non-alplhanumeric characters like $ and ^. In fact, it barely extends to numbers; I can do them, but slowly and with a high error rate. Since I often type in a darkened room, I therefore need the number keys lighted. For reasons I don't understand, this keyboard has the number and non-alphanumeric characters side-by-side rather than one above the other. This means that 2 characters are squeezed into 1/3 of the key's geography 1/6 for each. If they were above and below, they'd each have 1/2 the key, and thus could be larger and more easily readable. That just seems silly to me; why not take advantage of the available space? Because they're smaller, the very keys I need to see are dimmer.The same problem occurs on the |, ' "", [{ and other non-alplhanumeric keys, including the function keys. One of the keys needed for turning on the backlighting, F10, is now so dim I can't see it, evidently from frequent use, though I don't see why. Luckily, the keys on either side are lit, so I can figure it out.I like the keyboard's size and weight, and the switches are very nice. The inability to use the backlighting for its intended purpose, though, would prevent me from buying another.,Why go ABS when they now make PBT caps for this board? Get yourself this one for a more pleasant typing experience!Be aware Ducky LEDs under the Spacebar ""blinds"" you when you slouch at the right angle.

Only complaint is that the spacebar switch starts squeaking after typing a little bit. Other than that, its a well built keyboard,Very nice keyboard. The only complaint i have about it, is that the switch on the space bar isn't that smooth and squeaks sometimes,,What a fantastic keyboard. I have this same keyb with clears and it pales in comparison to this. The greens are so satisfying to type on. If you have a private office I'd definitely recommend greens over any other mx switch. They're not terribly loud, certainly quieter than my model m, but the stiff action makes the whole package desirable.Also kudos to Joel @ MK. I had originally ordered and then becomes frustrated with a preorder for a Pok3r RGB w/ browns (bleh). He was able to quickly change my order to an in-stock Pok3r with greens and get it shipped out same day. He refunded the difference immediately. Top notch! Thank you for the included keycap puller, I've already switched to a zebra wood 60% case and some retro pbt caps.,The folks at mechanicalkeyboards.com impressed me with my order for the Pok3r Black PBT with Chery MX Greens.  I had a shipping issue (that wasn't their fault) and they went above and beyond to help me resolve it.The keyboard was packaged great and I already love it.  I'm so glad I went with the Green switches instead of the Blues.  I'm not a particularly heavy typist, but the switches feel great while typing and they make my ears happy.  The heavy actuation helps me not bottom out.I love the keyboard, I love the switches, and I love the customer service at mk.com.,I have two of these.  I have this one as well as as LED backlit ABS model.  The PBT keys are great.  What I really like about this keyboard is the aluminum case.  It's built like a tank and feels really good to type on.  No flex at all.  Just a really solid feel.  I love the 60% but I wish I could get a full size also.  ,Amazing feeling switches &amp; just an overall great typing &amp; gaming experience. ,I love this little keyboard!  It's my first mechanical, and now I definitely want another one for at work.Pros:Programmable, so all my required functions are close at hand.Easy to transport.Very sturdy build quality (heavy!).Cherry MX clears feel great to type on.Cons:Mine was missing the 'Fn' keycap (has an extra 'Ctrl' keycap there instead).The legends are wearing off of the PBT keycaps after only two weeks of use.Backspace feels loose and makes a metallic clacking/pinging sound.Sometimes it doesn't work when my PC wakes from sleep, so I have to unplug it and plug it back in.The reason I rate it a 4 is because of my experience with Vortex' customer service in trying to get an 'Fn' keycap.  In short, they did not offer to send a replacement, and were inconsistent in responding to my support inquiry.,One of the best keyboards I've used, very small so good for desk space.,Love at first click!I bought the matias v60 and returned it. Bought the pok3r backlit version(with abs keycaps) and returned and finally bought this.It was love at first click. The pbt keys make way lesser noise than its counterpart abs. Cherry mx blue nothing more to say. They are just amazing to type in and I love the clicky sound.The construction is pretty solid. Love the form factor too. Don't be fooled by its size, its a pretty solid and heavy keyboard. The arrows are in the right place for me. I still haven't played around with the programming aspect yet because I just received. But anyone who likes cherry mx blue and wants to try the 60% keyboard. Pok3r is the way to go.I just love this keyboard. My keyboard search is finally over. ,I love this keyboard. It's currently my daily diver. There's plently of reviews online so I wont be going in depth on why I like it but the only con is that the keycaps that come with it are laser etched and will wear out over time.,Just got my board in the mail! It  arrived quickly and well packaged in perfect condition. This keyboard is incredible. If you haven't ever typed on clears then you're in for a real treat, if you have then you know what to look forward to. This keyboard is very high quality, great looking, and easy to use. The aluminum case has a very nice weight to it and keeps to board firmly planted to the desk surface. Can't recommend this board enough. Get one!,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7HepIAGuzgWatch my full review for an in depth review.Short versionVERY well builtPBT Stock capsPrice is amazing for Aluminum case with PBT capsOnly real cons that exist areDoes not include PS/2 AdapterLettering is not doubleshot so will eventually fade on Keycaps,A definitive and solid keyboardit's a tiny keyboard with a lot packed into it.,First mechanical, but been using red's frequently. Purchased a switch tester and came down between black and clear. I love linear which made me take it over clears, but i am positive i will be buying the clear with white caps soon. Build quality is great. Metal case is strong and sturdy. Very heavy for a 60%. Rubber feet are good. It can slide a little on my tabletop surface if i really try but while typing or bumping it, no way. Solid board especially if you are a traveler. ,My POK3R shipped rather quickly, the keyboard itself is incredible.  Outstanding build quality, the keyboard is extremely heavy and robust for its size.  The keycaps are solid and well-made, but the stem of each keycap can be seen in certain levels of light.  Overall, the keyboard is fantastic.","PKX6100-CEPV3,PKX6100-AEPV3,PKX6100-REPV3,PKX6100-BEPV3,PKX6100-WEPV3,PKX6100-GEPV3,PKX6100-SREPV3,PKX6100-SEPV3","{'Brand': 'Vortex', 'Model': 'POK3R', 'Size': '60%', 'Primary LED Color': 'n/a', 'Control LED Color': 'n/a', 'USB Key Rollover': '6', 'Multimedia Keys': 'Yes', 'Switch Mount Type': 'Plate', 'Built in Audio Port': 'No', 'Built in Mic Port': 'No', 'Interface(s)': 'USB', 'Windows Compatible': 'Yes', 'Mac Compatible': 'Yes', 'Linux Compatible': 'Yes', 'Warranty': '1 year', 'Dimensions': '11.60"" x 4.01"" x 1.50""', 'Cord Length': '59 inches'}","Cherry MX Blue,Cherry MX Black,Cherry MX Red,Cherry MX Brown,Cherry MX Clear,Cherry MX Green,Cherry MX Silent Red,Cherry MX Silver","Matthew Huynh,Matt Huynh,Eric Bostrom,Derek DePante,Mike,Mario Garretti,David Fuchs,Joshua Park,abhixec,Ayson Snow,gnomechild,LiquidEvilGaming,Jeremy Erdman,Breckan,Austin Wagner"

Paid for 3 day shipping or less and received my keyboard with a F6 key dead on arrival. No other colors made the key work and reseting didn't fix it. Support was nice and shipped out a new keyboard but after using it for two days and checking to see if I've gotten any debris in it, I find that it's not dirt. There's a scrap/dent in the wall by my 1 key. Since the the bottom is white and not black like the rest of it it stands out even more. Not really happy with my experience. If I ship it back I'm sure I'll just end up with another messed up keyboard for a third time.,This keyboard is a good one. It helped me with my typing. Now when I type it does not hurt my thumb.I recommend using rainbow mode to impress your friends and colleagues. XDDXDXDXD,This was my first mechanical keyboard, ever.  I just received it on 7/11/18.  I got mine with Cherry MX Silver switches, and it's absolutely amazing.  Keys take some getting used to, as my old membrane keyboard was 7 years old.  This is a night and day difference as far as responsiveness goes.  I hope this one will last just as long!  Software controls are great for this keyboard, and it has a lot of options as far as RGB effects go, and they are gorgeous!Also my first time ordering from MK.com.  Would do business again!  I just wish I didn't order before the US holiday to prevent a few extra days of free shipping.  No problems whatsoever!  ,I have had a Ducky Shine keyboard since 2011, just replaced the keycaps (second time). I must have very acid fingers, as no other backlit keyboard's keycaps last for long with me--the letters and numbers wear off in anywhere from a month to a year. Not so with the Ducky Shine. It has a good feel, is made well, and it lasts. It doesn't hurt that it's also aesthetically pleasing. I highly recommend this keyboard, and will be buying another one for a new computer build.  ,This is my first mechanical keyboard and it is a feels great and enjoyable to type.  The lighting has many varieties of lighting modes.  Great customer service and has a great RGB quality.  ,Love this keyboard, customer service was also great!!,This is my first mechanical keyboard so I can't really compare it to other options out there. That being said, this is a great keyboard. It is enjoyable to use when typing and works great with gaming. The lighting options are great and offer a variety of options (just download the software directly from the Ducky website). My only gripe is that it came with a extra space bar (plain one) that has some damage. Guess I'll stay with the year of the rooster space bar or get some other keycaps.,The perfect choice for someone who want a great RGB board with an awesome build quality far from the flimsy ""gaming"" keyboards. ,My first Ducky and I am extremely impressed. My previous K70 RGB feels like a toy compared to this. The Ducky is heavier and more rigid in spite of the K70's large aluminum backplate.This is also my first board with PBT keycaps - the feel is great and they don't sound hollow or tinny like the previous caps I've been used to. Out of the box, I think it was quieter even with the K70 having o-rings installed, and after moving the rings to the Ducky its perfect - quiet bottom-out with a solid feel.For heavy writing tasks or programming, I can't recommend this board enough. If you're a gamer and want quality rather than flashy features and dedicated macro keys, look no further.,I've had the ducky shine 6 for a few weeks now and honestly, it's amazing. The red switches work wonderfully and the build quality is immaculate. This is my go-to keyboard. I will never switch to any other company.  ,I bought this keyboard a little bit ago and this is by far one of the best keyboards I have ever owned the RGB looks nice the keyboard is sturdy the switches are good and everything works amazingly. I only have one problem my left arrow key for some reason is missing the red in RGB  like it has perfect colors and whenever the color uses red is wont match the other keys it wont go completely white and keeps the blue green color other than that this is an amazing keyboard and would recommend it i'll update my review if I get repairs because it came with a warranty ,Absolutely amazing keyboard.  I switched from a DAS Keyboard 1st gen over to the Ducky Shine 6 and love it.  The keys feel great and the lettering is superb.  I went with red cherry MX and the 40A-R damper rings.  The sound is not heavy and doesn't bottom out.  The DAS I had used brown which is a slightly heavier weight over the red.  I love the LED and Macro capabilities of this keyboard.  The only thing that would have made this keyboard any better than it already is, would have been the use of USB-C for the detachable cable.  Otherwise, I've found a new home.,Great keyboard with great features. You cannot find a better RGB keyboard for this price with amazing build quality and PBT keycaps.,Hands down the best keyboard I have experienced so far. I've been on the fence to jump to MX Cherry Reds after using MX Browns for over 8 years. I am so glad I made the switch. This keyboard fits the exact look I was going for, nice, sleek, not-overstated. I must say if you're going to splurge on this, go ahead and buy the floating key cap set. It truly takes it to the next level as far as looks and LED diffusion.Lastly, the software was a great nice addition, I was able to upgrade the firmware seamlessly and get the desired look within seconds. The UI is intuitive, sleek and did exactly what I wanted. I know there are a lot more ""edgy"" looking keyboards out there from various big brand names. But if you want the pure essence, look no further.Also side note, MK's original estimated shipping (standard) was 7 days, keyboard arrived in 3 days. Can't recommend them enough. Thank you for the great service.,I am extremely impressed with the quality of this keyboard, and it is worth the price. These non-floating keycaps are extremely durable and high quality PBT.Lighting is easy to configure, and macros are easy too, but only after reading the included guide.The reason I am giving 4/5 is due to a couple small gripes. First, the extra 2016 year of the monkey spacebar was warped on the side. This is a common issue with large, PBT keycaps, but it is very noticeable and shouldn't have passed Ducky's QA. Second, MK's shipping leaves a lot to be desired. I'd like to see them become more competitive with their shipping time and costs, as I'd prefer to support them over other larger retailers.,Just got this in the mail today.God's gift to keyboards Seriously though, I really liked the idea of certain lacquer covered keyboards from Leopold and some various designs coming from a myriad of keyboard makers but SILVER SPEEDS on the NEWEST Ducky model with the Calculator button within easy reach of your volume controls Built like a tank, and I thought my Ducky One (BrownMX) was built like a tank.  Ok, built like a tank from a country with tighter tolerances.This keyboard is beyond amazing.  Other than that, yeah it's always subjective, yadda yadda RGB and bought this with a Ducky wristwrest with my favourite colour stitching.,I bought this keyboard a while ago and have been very impressed.  It has replaced my WASD CODE for daily use.  I was kind of put off initially by the pictures of the serrated upper edge, but in person, they are not nearly as odd looking.  I was also happy that this keyboard came with normal keycaps - not the floating keycaps.  I also like the fact that the lighting settings are stored in the keyboard, so they stay the same as you move the keyboard to different machines or OS's. I'm not a gamer, I was looking for something fairly low-key that I could use in an office environment without feeling (or sounding) foolish, but also have RGB lighting for some keys.  This seems to fit.,I'm Planning to buy this keyboard, but i can tell already this is the perfect keyboard for me.,Straight up, this is the best Ducky board yet. I've owned Ducky 2, Ducky 3, Ducky Mini, Ducky Pocket, CoolerMaster, Kingston.all kinds of boards. This one is well crafted and the feel is great. Keycaps are perfect, the font on the keycaps are pleasing. The lighting effects are great, I mostly run it in red for better visuals in dark rooms. The Silver Cherry is a great new switch. My favorite thus far and I've tried them all. Can't go wrong with this board. Good for office/businessdoesn't stand out unless you want it to.","DKSH1608ST-AUSPDAAT1,DKSH1608ST-BUSPDAAT1,DKSH1608ST-CUSPDAAT1,DKSH1608ST-RUSPDAAT1,DKSH1608ST-PUSPDAAT1,DKSH1608ST-WUSPDAAT1","{'Brand': 'Ducky', 'Model': 'Shine 6', 'Size': 'Full Size', 'Physical Layout': 'US QWERTY', 'Logical Layout': 'ANSI', 'Frame Color': 'Black', 'Primary LED Color': 'RGB', 'Control LED Color': 'RGB', 'USB Key Rollover': 'Full', 'Multimedia Keys': 'Yes', 'Switch Mount Type': 'Plate', 'Built in Audio Port': 'No', 'Built in Mic Port': 'No', 'Interface(s)': 'USB', 'Windows Compatible': 'Yes', 'Dimensions': '17.71"" x 5.91"" x 1.77""', 'Weight': '2.20 lbs', 'Cord Length': '60 inches'}","Cherry MX Black,Cherry MX Brown,Cherry MX Blue,Cherry MX Red,Cherry MX Silver,Cherry MX Nature White","Taylor Estes,Dan,Brandon M,Pat,lex,Cody Harris,Russ,Helios,Robert M,M,James,William Seaton,Alexander,Ahmed Al-Rubaye,Kelsey,Greg Kovacs,JeffCD,Daniel,AJ Rodriguez"
